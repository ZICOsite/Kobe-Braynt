                    <p class="about__txt">Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, the youngest of three
                        children and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA player Joe Bryant. He was also the
                        maternal nephew of NBA player John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of
                        Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant menu. His middle name, Bean, was derived from his
                        father's nickname "Jellybean". Bryant's family was Catholic and he was brought up with this
                        faith.

                    <p class="about__txt">Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high-school career at
                        Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He
                        played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first freshman in decades
                        to start for Lower Merion's varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record. The
                        following three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions.
                        During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3
                        steals and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team Parade
                        All-American nomination, attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. Duke,
                        Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list. However, after high schooler
                        Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating
                        going directly to the pros.
